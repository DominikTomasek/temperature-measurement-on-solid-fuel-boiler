# temperature-measurement-on-solid-fuel-boiler
this project is for people who forget to add coal or wood to the boiler.  The measurement is done using a K type thermocouple together with a MAX6675 transducer and a lolin ESP8266 node MCU( I used this board as it was lying around at home). The thermocouple is attached to the flue pipe from the boiler from which it takes the temperature.
